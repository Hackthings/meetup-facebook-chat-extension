      "description": "<p>We get together every other weekend to play jazz.</p> <p><br/>If you plan to join the group, the most important thing you can tell us is what instrument you play. When you sign up for a session, please check the RSVP list in the column at the right. If we already have 3 or 4 guitarists, 2 keyboard players, a bassist, and a drummer, then we don't need any more of those instruments. Sign up for another session. And when you RSVP, write under your name the instrument you'll be playing.</p> <p><br/>This isn't a group for beginners. Many of the songs we play have complex melodies and harmonies. You should have some proficiency with your instrument, though you may be new to jazz.</p> <p><br/>We try to provide a place where musicians at different levels of ability and experience can come together, develop their skills as jazz players, and freely explore their creativity. Toward that end, we do not tolerate anyone criticizing another's playing.</p> <p><br/>Bring a copy of The Real Book (edition 6). Most of the songs we play are there. If you want to work on a song that's not in the book, you must bring lead sheets for everyone.</p> <p><br/>We'll be in one of the rooms at Music Makers, on the third floor. The address and directions are above. I'll usually let everyone know by Thursday which room we'll be in on Saturday. The rooms cost $72 for all three hours. We divide the cost equally.</p> <p><br/>If you've signed up for a jam and can't make it, you need to post a message or call or text me. There may be others who would like to take your place.</p> <p><br/>Don Jeffrey</p> ",

Please send inquiries to [masked]</p> <p><br/>And as this group is still in its infancy, we would like to keep it limited to people from Muslim backgrounds, as this will help us talk freely and comfortably knowing that we all come from the same place.</p> <p><br/>We will be meeting every two weeks, on Wednesdays, at 7PM, somewhere in Manhattan.</p> ",
